        a dip of ranch dressing or blue cheese dressing (the latter being 
        primarily served in New York). Hot Wings are also called as, just Wings, or 
        Buffalo Wings named such after Buffalo, New York, where they were invented.

        classic spicy, buttery Buffalo Sauce with a tinge of sweetness that 
        are made entirely in the oven and are guilt-free.
