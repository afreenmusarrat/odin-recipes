    <h1>Chicken Qorma</h1>

    <img src="../img/chicken-qorma.jpg" alt="Chicken Qorma" height="300" width="300">

    <p>Qorma is a dish consisting of meat or vegetables braised with yogurt and spices to 
        produce a thick sauce or gravy. It has its roots in the Mughlai cuisine
        of the Indian subcontinent. The flavour of a qorma is based on the mixture of spices,
        including ground coriander and cumin, combined with yogurt kept below curdling 
        temperature and incorporated slowly and carefully with the meat juices. Traditionally, 
        this was carried out in a pot set over a very low fire, with charcoal on the lid 
        to provide all-round heat. 
        <br>
        <br>The term shahi (English: royal), used for qormas, indicates its status 
        as a prestige dish, rather than an everyday meal, and its association with the court. 
        This recipe produces a perfect old delhi style qorma with its authentic tangy taste 
        which can be eaten along with pulao, rotis or parathas.
