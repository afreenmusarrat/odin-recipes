    <p>A chocolate brownie, or simply a brownie, is a chocolate baked dessert bar. 
        Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, 
        depending on their density. Brownies often have a glossy "skin" on their 
        upper crust. They may also include nuts, frosting, chocolate 
        chips, or other ingredients. A variation can be made with brown sugar and vanilla 
        rather than chocolate in the batter and is called a blond brownie or blondie. 
        <br>
        <br>Brownies may be accompanied by a glass of milk, served warm with ice cream, topped with 
        whipped cream, or sprinkled with powdered sugar. In most homes, they are common homemade 
        treats and are also popular in restaurants, ice cream parlors, and coffeehouses.
        This recipe makes the most fudgy chocolate brownies with a perfect glossy upper crust.
        They are goeey on the inside, crisp on the edges and will melt in your mouth as you eat.
